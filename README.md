# cc-dice

Probabilistic dice triggers for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) hooks.

Register dice slots, and cc-dice rolls them on every Claude Code stop event. Accumulators escalate probability with conversation depth; single/fixed slots give flat odds.

## Why

Claude Code sessions are long-running, stateful, and unpredictable, which reminds me of a video game. Very much like a tabletop RPG campaign. In D&D, dice are the core mechanic that makes emergent behavior possible. A Natural 20 happens because probability demands it and it changes the course of the game.

cc-dice is more of a nod to the mechanics than trying to become a sophisticated plugin. In fact, you can create a stop hook yourself with a flat 5% chance to mimic a d20 roll. However, cc-dice gives you what a one-liner can't: accumulating dice pools across turns, shared rolls across multiple slots, per-session cooldowns, and state that persists across turns.

This creates moments that feel organic rather than scheduled. A prompt to invoke a skill that fires at turn 42 because the dice finally landed without any intervention. Your agents are part of the campaign.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pro-vi/cc-dice/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pro-vi/cc-dice.git
cd cc-dice && ./install.sh
```

Requires [bun](https://bun.sh), [git](https://git-scm.com), and [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

```bash
./install.sh check      # verify
./install.sh uninstall   # remove
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Register an accumulator slot (escalating probability)
cc-dice register refactor \
  --die 20 --target 20 --type accumulator \
  --message "Cast /refactor and review your current work."

# Register a flat-chance slot
cc-dice register second-opinion \
  --die 20 --target 2 --type single \
  --message "Get a second opinion (e.g. from codex)."

# Check status
cc-dice status refactor

# Manual roll (dry run, no state change)
cc-dice roll second-opinion
```

That's it. The installed stop hook rolls all slots automatically on every Claude Code stop event.

## How Hooks Work

The installer registers a **Stop** hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`. On each stop:

1. Hook receives `{ session_id, transcript_path }` on stdin
2. `checkAllSlots()` groups slots by die size, rolls one base die per group
3. Each slot checks its target against shared/bonus rolls
4. On trigger: `🎲 Nat {best}! {message}` shown to Claude via stderr (exit `2`)
5. No triggers: exit `0` (roll results visible to user only)

A **SessionStart** hook clears state for slots with `clearOnSessionStart` (default).

## Slot Configuration

```bash
cc-dice register <name> [options]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--die <n>` | 20 | Die size (d20, d6, etc.) |
| `--target <n>` | 20 | Target number |
| `--target-mode <mode>` | exact | `exact`, `gte`, or `lte` |
| `--type <type>` | accumulator | `accumulator`, `fixed`, or `single` |
| `--accumulation-rate <n>` | 7 | Turns per +1 die (accumulator only) |
| `--max-dice <n>` | 100 | Dice cap (accumulator only) |
| `--fixed-count <n>` | 1 | Dice count (fixed only) |
| `--cooldown <mode>` | per-session | `per-session` or `none` |
| `--no-clear-on-start` | | Don't clear state on session start |
| `--no-reset-on-trigger` | | Don't reset accumulator on trigger |
| `--no-flavor` | | Don't prepend dice emoji + roll lingo |
| `--message <msg>` | | Message shown to Claude on trigger |

### Message Placeholders

`{rolls}`, `{best}`, `{diceCount}`, `{slotName}` are replaced at trigger time.

By default, trigger output is prefixed with `🎲 Nat {best}!` — disable with `--no-flavor`.

### Dice Types

**Accumulator**: +1 die per N turns since last trigger. Escalating pressure.

```
Turns 0-6:   0 dice (0%)      Turns 14-20: 2d20  (9.8%)
Turns 7-13:  1d20  (5%)       Turns 21-27: 3d20  (14.3%)
```

**Single**: Always 1 die. Flat chance every stop event.

**Fixed**: Always N dice. Constant probability.

## Shared Roll Pools

Slots sharing a die size observe the same base roll:

- Two single d20 slots claiming different faces are mutually exclusive
- An accumulator d20 slot gets the shared base roll + independent bonus dice
- Different die sizes (d20 vs d6) roll independently

This means registering `reflection` (target 20) and `second-opinion` (target 1) on a d20 guarantees at most one triggers per base roll.

## CLI Reference

```
cc-dice register <name> [options]   Register a dice slot
cc-dice unregister <name>           Remove a slot
cc-dice list                        List all slots
cc-dice status <name>               Show dice status
cc-dice roll <name>                 Dry-run roll
cc-dice reset <name>                Reset accumulator
cc-dice clear <name>                Clear state
```

## Storage

```
~/.claude/dice/
  slots.json                          Slot registry
  state/
    {slotName}-{sessionId}.json       Per-slot per-session state
    triggered-{slotName}-{sessionId}  Cooldown markers
```

## Library API

Hooks and scripts can import via the installed symlink:

```typescript
const { registerSlot, checkAllSlots } =
  await import(`${process.env.HOME}/.claude/dice/cc-dice.ts`);
```

Or from the source tree directly:

```typescript
import { registerSlot, checkAllSlots } from "./src/index";
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CC_DICE_BASE` | Override base directory (default: `~/.claude/dice/`) |
| `CC_DICE_SESSION_ID` | Override session ID |
| `DEBUG=1` | Verbose logging to stderr |

## Troubleshooting

**`./install.sh check` shows broken symlinks**: The source directory was moved or deleted. Re-run `./install.sh` to re-link.

**Hook not firing**: Verify with `./install.sh check` that hooks are registered in `settings.json`. Use `cc-dice roll <name>` to test a dry run.

**State not clearing between sessions**: Ensure the SessionStart hook is registered. Use `cc-dice clear <name>` to reset a specific slot manually.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pro-vi/cc-dice.git
cd cc-dice
bun install
bun test
```

Test submodules (bats-core, bats-support, bats-assert) are required. If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
